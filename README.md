# Node Authentication Assignment

This repository contains the code for an authentication-related assignment using Node.js. It demonstrates the implementation of user authentication features such as password hashing and JWT token generation.
# Node.js Authentication System with JWT

This project demonstrates a **JWT-based authentication system** using **Node.js** and **Express**. It includes functionality for **user registration**, **login**, **JWT token verification**, and **role-based authorization**. The system uses **hashed passwords** for secure storage and **JWT tokens** for stateless authentication.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register by providing a username, password, and role.
- **User Login**: Users can log in with their credentials, and receive a JWT token upon success.
- **Token Verification**: The application can verify the JWT token to authenticate requests.
- **Role-based Authorization**: Admin users can access protected routes like adding, updating, and deleting books.
